# Documentation of modules and processing flow


## omSipCreator

This module contains the main function, which does the following things:

- Set up a logger instance
- Define all namespaces and schemas for METS output
- Initialise package-wide shared flags and variables
- Get user input from the command-line
- Locate MediaInfo binaries
- Create a Batch instance (using *batch.Batch*)
- Process the batch using *batch.Batch.process*; prune the batch using *batch.Batch.prune* (only if the *prune* command was used)

## batch

This module contains the *Batch* class, which represents a batch and its properties. It includes the functions *process* and *prune*.

### process function

Processes a batch, which involves the following steps:

- Parse the batch manifest and store the contents to two lists (one for the column headers, and one for the actual data)
- Do some basic checks on the data in the batch manifest (do all required columns exist; does every entry have the expected number of columns)
- Sort and group all entries in batch manifest by PPN
- Then for each unique PPN value:
    * Create a PPN instance (using *ppn.PPN*)
    * Call the PPN processing function (using *ppn.PPN.proces*)
- Check if all directories in the batch that were encountered in the above step are represented in the batch manifest
- Collect any errors and warning that were encountered in the above steps

### prune function

- Create an error batch directory
- Copy directories for all PPNs for which errors were reported to the error batch (including post-copy checksum verification); exit if checksum verification fails
- Update batch manifest in source batch + make copy of original batch manifest. Make batch manifest for error batch
- Collect any errors and warning that were encountered in the above steps

## ppn

This module contains the *PPN* class, which represents a PPN (or more precisely, an intellectual entity that corresponds to a PPN, which in turn comprises all carriers that are to be included in one SIP) and its properties. It includes the function *process*.

### process function

Processes one intellectual entity, which involves the following steps:

- Create a METS element and its top-level subelements
- Query catalogue for bibliographical metadata, convert to MODS and append result to METS *dmdSec* section
- Initialise counters that are used to assign file- and carrier-level identifiers in the METS for this SIP
- Create a SIP directory (only if the *write* commnand is used)
- Sort and group all carriers that belong to this PPN by carrier type
- For each carrier:
    * Create a Carrier instance (using *carrier.Carrier*)
    * Call the Carrier processing function (using *carrier.Carrier.process*)
    * Append all *file* elements for this carrier (generated by  *carrier.Carrier.process*) to the *fileGrp* element in the METS *fileSec* section
    * Append all file-level *div* elements (generated by  *carrier.Carrier.process*) to the the carrier-level *div* element in the METS *structMap* section
    * Append all file-level *techMD* elements (generated by  *carrier.Carrier.process*) to the METS *amdSec* section
    * Create a carrier-level *techMD* element and append the serialized cd-info output element (generated by  *carrier.Carrier.process*) to it
    * Create a carrier-level *digiprovMD* element and append the PREMIS creation events (generated by  *carrier.Carrier.process*) to it
    * Do some quality and consistency checks on the batch manifest entry for this carrier


<!--### Input

* carrier: Carrier class instance (created in processPPN) for this carrier
* SIPPath: SIP directory (config.dirOut/PPN)
* sipFileCounterStart: start value for within-SIP file counter
* counterTechMDStart: start value for within-SIP counterTechMD counter

### Output

Dictionary *carrierOut* with following elements:

* divFileElements: list with, *div* elements for all file-level structMap components (level 3 in SIP specification)
* fileElements: list, with *file* elements for all files that are part of carrier.
* techMDFileElements: list with file-level techMD elements
* premisCreationEvents: list with PREMIS imaging/ripping events (Isobuster/dBpoweramp logs)
* cdInfoElt: element, serialized cd-info output
* sipFileCounter: updated within-SIP file counter
* counterTechMD: updated within-SIP counterTechMD counter
-->

## carrier

This module contains the *Carrier* class, which represents an individual carrier (disc) and its properties. It includes the function *process*.

### process function

Processes one carrier, which involves the following steps:

- Create a METS element and its top-level subelements

The function populates the following attributes, which are used by *ppn.PPN.proces*:

- divFileElements: list with *div* elements for all file-level structMap components (level 3 in [SIP specification](./sip-spec.md))
- fileElements: list with *file* elements for all files that are part of carrier
- techMDFileElements: list with file-level *techMD* elements
- premisCreationEvents: list with PREMIS imaging/ripping events (Isobuster/dBpoweramp logs)
- cdInfoElt: lxml element with serialized cd-info output

In addition, it returns updated values of the following variables:

* sipFileCounter: incremental counter of each file in the SIP
* counterTechMD: incremental counter for each *techMD* section in the SIP



<!-- ## Naming

addCreationEvent, addAgent, addObjectInstance in premis.py: perhaps change *add* to *create* (since these functions do not *add* anything) -->
